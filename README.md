This is the implementation of a full website based on PHP MVC.

Using MySql database to create a website.

And Bootstrap4 for front-end.


## Start 
First install xampp and open phpmyadmin.<br />
We need to create a database and rewrite the configurations in <b>/database/Database.php</b>.
Import the <i>create.sql</i> file in your database in phpmyadmin.

After that if you are on:
<ul>
    <li>Windows, execute the <b>run.bat</b> file to start the server. </li>
    <li>Linux, execute the <b>run.bash</b> file to start the server. </li>
</ul>

You need to get a response like this:
```shell
